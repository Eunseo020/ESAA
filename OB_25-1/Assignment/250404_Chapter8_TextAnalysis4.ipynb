it was fine .\\n29

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .\\n66

for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .\\n70

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

                                             On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .\\n75

that I had ordered .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .\\n78

has free internet service .\\n49                                                                   no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .\\n50

bill it to our room .\\n51                                 30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet

utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .\\n86

   The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                               I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .\\n1                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                  I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3

                                                                                                                                       My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14

download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                                                         For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .\\n17

loss .\\n18                                                                                                                                                   At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                            On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                  Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .\\n23                                                              Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .\\n27                                                                                                                                              I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28

accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                          The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                              So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35

     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80

communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82

                                                                                                                               Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

                                                                        The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?\\n22

would stay here again .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                               They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .\\n25

it was fine .\\n29

                          I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n31

more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .\\n32                                                                                                                                              However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .\\n33

                                                           Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

           30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was

                                               There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it

                                                                                                                                                                                           But there are

minutes .\\n63

  on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

at best as a Motel 6 quality .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                  Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

the service was very slow .\\n135                                         Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .\\n20

staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n21

accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .\\n25

price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .\\n26

                       I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .\\n3

this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6

              The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .\\n14

much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                  It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .\\n20

the voice files were 100\\n21                                                                                                                                                                                                       Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .\\n22

                                  Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n24                                                                                                The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                              So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74

in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85

and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87

                                                                                                                                                              The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .\\n4                    Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n5                                                                                                                                                           The issue with the battery door opening

                                       Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .\\n7

                                                                                 You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .\\n9

intended !\\n10   Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n11

with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .\\n12

noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .\\n14

                            Kindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted

and decent water pressure .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                       The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .\\n26

Coit Tower as well .\\n27

                                                                                                                                              Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .\\n30

respectively .\\n31

                                              The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .\\n33

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65

the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

                  The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

         Styling is bland, the engine isn't strong at all, and the car doesn't deliver good comfort while driving it .\\n9

                                 It's a pretty good car, reliable, comfortable as far as it goes, but limited rear visibility because of high rear bumper, and a problem with its computer  learning  my  driving style .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                             The

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

    The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46

           It's very comfortable and a quiet ride with low levels of road and wind noise .\\n73                                                                                                                                                            The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable,

straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                 I have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64

  Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                       Very peppy engine great fuel mileage 28, 30 combined .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91                                                                                                                                                         It is great to drive, has many nice features and gets you there with great mileage .\\n92

                                                                                                                                                                     I had rather not have it and sacrifice the mileage .\\n94                                                                                                                                               The gas mileage has been as advertised, hitting 32 mpg on the highway when driving at 65 MPH .\\n95                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage after 1000 miles is averaging apprx 23,  24 mpg in a blend of city highway .\\n96

hesitates during acceleration\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                I drive around 60 miles a day so fuel mileage was important .\\n100

                                                                                                                                                         with gas prices, wanted better mileage .\\n103

the  sedan  from looking boring, the gas mileage is great, the price point was right, and the reliability is terrific .\\n106

couple of weeks ago, having driven a pick up for the last 25 years, i was really surprised at how much i like this car, going from a big v, 8 to a 4 is a change but the power is good, gas mileage is great .\\n108                                                                                                                                    At first the gas mileage was a disappointment, but as the car is now breaking in   it's getting better .\\n109                                                                                                                 I test the car and was very impressed with the looks and the 4cyl was adequate since gas mileage was very important to me .\\n110

mechanisms, the ability to read in either vertical or horizontal mode, and the ability to make the text scroll on the page, like a teleprompter, at a speed of your choosing .\\n16

show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57

blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .\\n34   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

                                  The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n37

unit out of the box .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                                                                             I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

.\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend's TomTom 910 .\\n44

have time to really read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .\\n47

                                                                                                                                                                                    large screen, text

the satellites .\\n50

the next day it has the satellites instantly .\\n52

the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .\\n54

my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .\\n56

                                        Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58

capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59

It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .\\n61

will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                         ,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18                                                                                                                                                                             The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n19

Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26

my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36

change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77

                                                                                                                         The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .\\n80

                                                                                                                          The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                                              Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .\\n83                                                                                                                                           I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .\\n84

position when moving, not choppy on the screen .\\n89

of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                               When attached to the PC, the screen just indicates the connection .\\n93

                                                                                                           We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330

quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                  Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                               Headroom body room comfort great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                   It is very quiet and comfortable .\\n55

                                               Very comfortable seating position for both me and my husband .\\n57

                                                                                    For the price I couldn't have asked for a better performing, comfortable and stylish whip .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                              The seating is relatively

incredible, with a smooth and comfortable ride .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                  I'm 6'3  and I find this car very comfortable to drive or ride in .\\n62                                                                                                                                     My friends say my car is just like a Lexus and I have to agree, very comfortable and beautiful .\\n63                                                                                                                                           Seats are comfortable, but wish the seat bottoms tilted back more into a bucket position .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                         Solid, high quality, comfortable and quiet .\\n65

   Superb handling, performance and comfort .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                Turns out, it was one of the smoothest, most comfortable rides ever .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .\\n69

                                                                                                                        Very quiet and comfortable ride, more than enough power .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                It is very reliable and

quiet ride with low levels of road and wind noise .\\n73                                                                                                                                                            The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74                                                                                                                                                 I do not find the front seats as comfortable as the seats in my old 96 Ford taurus .\\n75                                                                                                                Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable, quite and smooth ride .\\n77                                                                              The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats

great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                   Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage .\\n88                                                                                                                           Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system is easy to use .\\n98                                                                I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100                                                                                                                                                                                                 Leather interior very comfortable .\\n101                                                                                                                                My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107                                                                                                                                              Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .\\n108                                                                                                                                                                                              Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109                                                                                                                                      The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110                                                                                                                                                               Extremely comfortable with 3 separate power driver seat adjustments .\\n111                                                                                                                                                 I purchased a Camry LE approximately 2 months ago, it's a smooth comfortable ride .\\n112                                                                                                                                                                              I selected the Camry for its comfort and reliability .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                This new Camry is indeed very comfortable with quiet and soft ride .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                    Very uncomfortable when driving long distances .\\n115                                                                                                                            I am not real fond of the electric seat and I find it is not as comfortable as my F150 pickup on trips .\\n116
